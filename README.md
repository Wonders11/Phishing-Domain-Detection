Complete EDA Conclusion:
1.There are no missing values in the data
2.There is no categorical features so conversion of categorical features to numerical feature won't be needed
3.There are outliers present in the numerical feature so that needs to be handled
4.Data transformation needs to be done in order to bring all features in same scale
5.There is large difference in output label numbers ..it is an imbalanced dataset so we need to handle it

Machine learning algorithms used :
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Classification
3. Decision Tree Classification
4. Random Forest Classification
5. XGBoost Classification
6. Gradient Boosting Classification
